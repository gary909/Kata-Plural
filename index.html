    <h1>Kata: Plural</h1>
    <p>
        We need a simple function that determines if a plural is needed or not. It should take a number, <br>
        and return true if a plural should be used with that number or false if not. This would be useful <br>
        when printing out a string such as 5 minutes, 14 apples, or 1 sun.<br>
        <br>
        You only need to worry about english grammar rules for this kata, where anything that isn't singular <br>
        (one of something), it is plural (not one of something).<br>
        <br>
        All values will be positive integers or floats, or zero.<br>
